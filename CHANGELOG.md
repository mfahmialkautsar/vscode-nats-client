## [0.0.3] - 2025-11-20

### Added

- Manage NATS connections, subscriptions, and reply handlers directly from the Command Palette and the connection UI: list active items, stop or reconnect them, and quickly reveal output channels.
- Progress indicators for publish and request operations so you can see live status for long-running actions.
- Commands to check connection health and flush in-flight messages from the Command Palette.
- Now available on the Open VSX Registry.

### Improved

- Increased session stability: transient network interruptions are handled more smoothly and subscriptions are preserved where possible, reducing message loss and reconnect interruptions.
- Formatting and parsing improvements for `.nats` documents: formatting now preserves delimiter text and the parser recognizes delimiter lines with trailing text for more predictable edits.

### Changed

- Minimum supported VS Code version updated to 1.93.0 and Node.js version to 20.0.0.

## [0.0.2] - 2025-11-19

### Features

- View active NATS subscriptions and reply handlers from the Command Palette; take actions directly (unsubscribe, stop handler, reveal output).

## [0.0.1] - 2025-11-17

### Added

- `.nats` document parser with support for `SUBSCRIBE`, `PUBLISH`, `REQUEST`, `REPLY`, and `JETSTREAM` blocks plus headers, payload templating, and `randomId()` helpers.
- CodeLens runner that starts subscriptions, reply handlers, JetStream pulls, and ad-hoc publish/request actions directly from the editor.
- Structured output channels, connection-aware status bar updates, and a quick connection reset menu.
- Environment-scoped variable tree view with `{{token}}` and `{{env:VAR_NAME}}` substitutions consumed by the session layer.
- JetStream durable pull command with batch size and timeout overrides mapped from headers.
- CI workflow covering formatting, linting, typing, unit tests, e2e tests, integration harness, and a gated Marketplace publish job for tagged releases.
